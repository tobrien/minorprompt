MinorPrompt helps you capture and create Prompts.

MinoPrompt was designed to help people create prompts that are structured.

To use MinorPrompt you create Sections that contant Instructions, Context, and Content to create a Prompt that is structured.

The name MinorPrompt was inspired by the name of the band MinorThreat.

MinorPrompt has a Parser that can read sections of Instructions that are stored in Markdown, and it also has a Formatter that is used to generate content in either Markdown or in a format that uses tags that resemble something like XML.

MinorPrompt is written in Typescript and uses Jest for testing and Vite and SWC to build the library.  MinorPrompt uses the "marked" library to parse Markdown.
